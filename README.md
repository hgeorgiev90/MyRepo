## Eight Queens Puzzle

This repository includes a simple C# program to compute all solutions to the classic 8 queens puzzle. To compile and run the program, you can use the `csc` compiler that comes with the .NET SDK:

```bash
csc EightQueens.cs
mono EightQueens.exe
```

The program will print each solution using `Q` to represent queens and `.` for empty spaces.
